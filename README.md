# BitTorrent #

A peer to peer, java based file transfer application.

### What is this repository for? ###

BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. We have focussed on
implementing the choking-unchoking mechanism which is one of the most important features of BitTorrent. 
The protocol implemented has been modified a little bit from the original BitTorrent protocol.
Details of the protocol can be found in the project details folder of the project.

### How do I get set up? ###
Coming soon.
